# Introduction

We aim to evaluate your programming skills in a comfortable setting by discussing a piece of code you've written. This approach ensures a stress-free dialogue about your solution, allowing us to better understand your engineering capabilities.

Thank you for participating in this process.

# Task Description

Your task is to develop a small web app that facilitates viewing of media (images or videos) in various ways, reflecting the central role of images in our product line.

## Features

Your app should be a video player with normal playback functionality as well as frame-by-frame skipping. Additionally, it should have the following features:

1. **Video Viewer**
   - Implement a video viewer with a fullscreen mode.
   - Allow users to navigate through a collection of videos and switch between their top/bottom light variants.

2. **Split-View**
   - Develop a resizable split view for comparing top/bottom light videos
   - Implement a draggable divider to adjust view proportions

3. **Annotations**
   - Allow users to add markers of interest that appear on videos
   - Make sure that these persistent annotations stay positioned correctly during playback
   - Clicking them again removes them

# Submission Guidelines

Please submit your solution including the source code, instructions necessary to run it, and any assumptions you've made during development!

## Evaluation Criteria

We will assess your submission based on the following:

- Compatibility with Mac/Linux
- Code clarity and structure.
- Fulfillment of the task objectives.
- Build reproducibility.
- Design choices and implementation decisions.

We look forward to discussing your solution and understanding your approach!
