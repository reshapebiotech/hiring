# Introduction

We aim to evaluate your programming skills in a comfortable setting by discussing a piece of code you've written. This approach ensures a stress-free dialogue about your solution, allowing us to better understand your engineering capabilities.

Thank you for participating in this process.

# Task Description

Your task is to develop a small web app that facilitates viewing of media images in various ways, reflecting the central role of images in our product line.

## Features

Your app should be a image viewer and it should have the following features:

1. **Select images** (Single view)
   - Implement a library selector that allows users to select image pairs from a library
   - Each image library item includes two images that are variants of the same object that can be inspected together
   - In the single view one image is displayed at a time with a selector to switch between the image variants
   - Images can be found in the library directory. Each subdir contains a set of two items that go together. You can also add your own!

2. **Split View**
   - Develop a resizable split view for comparing the image variants
   - Implement a draggable divider that allows the user to split view the two variants at the same time

3. **Blending view**
   - Develop a way to blend two images together
   - Decide on method for doing the blending. Explain your choice.

4. **Choose your own adventure view**
   - Develop a novel way to view the image sets together
   - Dont think too hard about it. Anything goes here

The project comes with a figma file that you can use to design your UI. You can find it here https://www.figma.com/design/OCGjuuuk0ccse9Xz4AZj5Z/Frontend-Challenge

Make sure that your project:
- Follows the design
- Is reasonably responsive - scales to fit different screen sizes. Mobile-friendly is not in scope though
- Otherwise, feel free to make some choices and assumptions along the way. Remember this is about us getting a glimpse into your skills, not about this app.


# Submission Guidelines

Please submit your solution including the source code, instructions necessary to run it, and any assumptions you've made during development!

We would love to limit the scope of the exercise to max 5 hours. If possible, try to stop at 5 hours and we'll discuss what you have so far.

## Evaluation Criteria

We will assess your submission based on the following:

- Code clarity and structure.
- Fulfillment of the task objectives.
- Build reproducibility.
- Design choices and implementation decisions.

We look forward to discussing your solution and understanding your approach!
