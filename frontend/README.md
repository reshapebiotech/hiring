# Introduction

We aim to evaluate your programming skills in a comfortable setting by discussing a piece of code you've written. This approach ensures a stress-free dialogue about your solution, allowing us to better understand your engineering capabilities.

Thank you for participating in this process.

# Task Description

Your task is to develop a small web app that facilitates viewing of media images in various ways, reflecting the central role of images in our product line.

## Features

Your app should be a image viewer with it should have the following features:

1. **Select images**
   - Implement a library selector that allows users to select images from a library
   - Each image library item includes two images that are variants of the same object that can be inspected together
   - In the default view, one image is displayed at a time with a selector to switch between the image variants

2. **Split View**
   - Develop a resizable split view for comparing top/bottom light videos
   - Implement a draggable divider to adjust view proportions

3. **Blending view**
   - Develop a way to blend two images together
   - Decide on method for doing the blending. Explain your choice.
   - If you need extra input elements to control the blending, implement them.

4. **Choose your own adventure view**
   - Develop a novel way to view the image sets together
   - Dont think too hard about it. Anything goes here

Make sure that your app is:

- Responsive - scales to fit different screen sizes. Mobile-friendly is not in scope though
- Fast and efficient
- Intuitive and easy to use


The project comes with a figma file that you can use to design your UI. You can find it in the `frontend/figma` directory. We would recommend using headless UI components for the UI, e.g. https://bits-ui.com/

# Submission Guidelines

Please submit your solution including the source code, instructions necessary to run it, and any assumptions you've made during development!

## Evaluation Criteria

We will assess your submission based on the following:

- Compatibility with Mac/Linux
- Code clarity and structure.
- Fulfillment of the task objectives.
- Build reproducibility.
- Design choices and implementation decisions.

We look forward to discussing your solution and understanding your approach!
