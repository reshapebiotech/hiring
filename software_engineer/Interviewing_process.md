# Interview process for software engineering positions (WIP)

## Screening

We're interested in finding capable engineers with lots of relevant and perhaps varied experience. Here are some great qualification bullets:


- Takes ownership
- Relevant experience
- Track record of solving interesting problems and providing meaningful value at previous employers
- Product-person. Very motivated by building great products
- Clean and concise CV.
  - ~~Grammer~~ grammar, spelling mistakes and so on provides a full picture and will be part of the evaluation


## Initial interview

Mostly a vibe check. Assessing communication skills, trying to gauge skills by understanding how the person talks about previous experiences and what they've actually solved.

**Almost always should be done IRL** - give a quick tour, talk about our company, what we do and what we're looking for.

Make sure to make the candidate feel **comfortable and relaxed** for best results for everyone involved. We're actively trying to avoid scaring away highly productive individuals that just needs a bit of comfort during the interviewing process.


## Technical competency interview

There are two ways of doing this part of the screening:
1) Candidates sends a project (with code) and we spend time analyzing and finding meaningful segments to talk about
2) We send the candidate a small exercise we have (see exercise.md, only have backend version for now)

Regardles off which is picked, we meet up and talk a bit more in details about the exercise, ask relevant questions and give our best evaluation of the candidates answers


The goal us to understand the candidate's technical capabilities and still make it a comfortable interview! 

Dont ask leading questions that you're set on an answer. Open-ended discussions are preferred!

## Culture-fit
