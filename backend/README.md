# Introduction

We aim to evaluate your programming skills in a comfortable setting by discussing a piece of code you've written. This approach ensures a stress-free dialogue about your solution, allowing us to better understand your engineering capabilities.

Thank you for participating in this process.

# Task Description

Develop a small API service for image manipulation. Image processing is central to our technology stack, so it serves as a great case for normal feature development.

**Requirements:**
- Support JPEG and PNG formats
- Accept images as either binary data in request or via URL (not both simultaneously)
- Example images are available in the `images` directory
- Preferred languages: Python or TypeScript - Please let us know if you would like to use something else.

### Endpoints

1. **Center Crop**
   - Crop an image from its center with specified dimensions

2. **Image Difference**
   - Calculate and return a score representing the difference between two images
   - Explain your chosen comparison method

3. **Image Hash**
   - Generate a unique identifier hash for a given image

All endpoints must perform appropriate validation and return relevant HTTP status codes.

# Submission Guidelines

Please submit your solution including the source code, instructions necessary to run it, and any assumptions you've made during development.

## Evaluation Criteria

We will assess your submission based on the following:

- Compatibility with Mac/Linux
- Code clarity and structure.
- Fulfillment of the task objectives.
- Build reproducibility.
- Design choices and implementation decisions.

We look forward to discussing your solution and understanding your approach!
